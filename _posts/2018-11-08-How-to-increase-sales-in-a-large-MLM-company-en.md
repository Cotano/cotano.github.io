Cotano was created as a simple, intuitive mobile sales application that allows salespeople to effectively develop relationships with their customers without a disciplined routine. We began by investigating the scope of sales and focused specifically on direct sales, in particular, Multilevel Marketing (MLM) companies. After successfully negotiating with one of the largest MLM companies, we were able to launch a pilot in several geographical regions and began testing the effectiveness of our application.

We are happy with the results because we can now confidently say that salespeople from MLM companies using Cotano are proven to sell more!

## How it all began?
We began piloting in near the end of 2017.

We spent most of our time communicating with our users(salespeople) who were engaged in direct sales. Our main goal was to identify their problems and pains. We achieved this by obtaining feedback from every single salesperson taking part in the pilot, in order to turn our application into a real “painkiller” for direct sales. During the test period, we corresponded with the 1000 users and company executives using multiple channels like phone, face-to-face, in app messenger, email, etc. 

We also communicated with representatives throughout the entire hierarchy of the company's management, including analysts and IT specialists. We also went into the “field” and sold their products together. 

Our hard work was not in vain!

## What we discovered?
Researching our users and their workflows lead to some powerful discoveries:

the companies previous digital tools were too distant and did not fit into their salespeople’s workflow;

salespeople used paper notebooks to control and organize their sales funnel;

the most active salespeople desired a mobile application for selling on-the-go, Anytime & Anywhere;

the company’s standards and rules for sales were formed over the years but non were implemented in the existing digital tools;

technical support, to put it mildly, stunk, and the technical equipment in the call-center was stuck in the "Stone Age";

the inertia of introducing previous digital solutions often destroyed their value;

regional sales managers lacked integrated tools for managing sales teams.

It is important to note that introducing Cotano was complicated because the salespeople of MLM company were not actually employees, but rather independent entrepenuaers and could not be forced to use our application. Luckily, in our case they began using Cotano and our active users began increasing every single week. We brought value to the salespeople hence they loved using it!

As a result of a systematic acquisition of feedback and the introduction of Cotano into the workflow, we created a real “painkiller” for users. We used the Kanban methodology, Smart push-notifications, best follow-up practices and the ability to easily import leads, a 20% increase in sales was observed during the test period (6 campaigns from 9 to 14 from June to November 2018). Cotano actually increased the salespeople’s activity in the campaigns, each of which lasted 21 days (Fig. 1).

## New opportunities
We identified a high correlation coefficient (0.97), and received numerous testimonials from users who really fell in love with Cotano. They testified to the close relationship between their effectiveness during the campaigns and usage of Cotano.

Using our application, they were able to:

visualize the sales funnel;

remove annoying routine from their workflow;

accelerate the sales cycle;

easily manage a team in a single platform;

automatically track progress;

build strong relationships with their customers because of personalization;

close orders and deals quicker and easier;

and finally earn more!

After covering all the problems and pains of the pilot users, the principle of "virality" worked and the word about Cotano spread quickly! ))) Cotano sold itself to other geographical regions, and we are still watching with excitement as the MLM’s salespeople, not involved in the pilot, are downloading and enjoying Cotano.

We are now ready to listen to our new users and have set the bar even higher!
