We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the SaaS Services, and as further detailed below.
<br><br>
<b>1.2. Cookies information.</b> When you visit our Website or access our SaaS Services via browser, we and our service providers acting on our behalf, may automatically collect certain information using tracking technologies like cookies and similar technologies.
<br><br>
We currently use, and may use in the future, the following types of cookies on our Website and the SaaS Services:
<br><br>
<em>Session cookies:</em> These are temporary cookies that only stored on your device (i.e. desktop computer, laptop, tablet or mobile phone) during a single visit to a website (called a “browser session”) and expire when you leave the website. These cookies help us maintain security and verify your details whilst you use our Website as you navigate from page to page, which enables you to avoid having to re-enter your details each time you enter a new page.
<br><br>
<em>Persistent cookies:</em> These remain on your device until they are set to expire or you choose to delete them from your browser cache. They are activated each time you visit the website that created them. For example, a persistent cookie lets us remember you when you return, helps analyze your behavior while you are on the site, and lets us identify any problems.
<br><br>
Both session cookies and persistent cookies are first-party cookies which belong to Cotano. In addition to our first-party cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of our Website and refine marketing efforts.
<br><br>
<em>Third-party cookies:</em> These are cookies that another party places on your browsing device through our Website. These cookies help us recognise you as a unique user when you return to our Website so that you do not have to input your details multiple times as you move between pages or the SaaS Services. Third-party cookies provide a service to Cotano, however Cotano cannot control how those third-party cookies are used.
<br><br>
We collect and may store information that your computer or mobile device provides to us when accessing our SaaS Services via browser or in connection with your use of the Website, such as your IP address or other device address, web browser and/or device type, browser language, mobile carrier, unique device identifier, the web pages or sites visited just before or just after using the SaaS Services, the content the Customer or Authorized User views or interacts with on the SaaS Services, and the dates and times of the visit, access, or use of the SaaS Service.
<br><br>
We collect this information to: i) personalize our SaaS Services, such as remembering users’ information so that Authorized Users or Customers will not have to re-enter it during a visit or on subsequent visits; (ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information; (iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the SaaS Service; (iv) monitor aggregate website usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (v) track your entries, submissions, and status in any activities on the Service.
<br><br>
If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your device, you should set your browser to refuse cookies before using our Website. You can obtain more information about cookies by visiting http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
<br><br>
<b>1.3. Log file information:</b> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page or other content within the SaaS Services. We may also receive log information relating to your computer or mobile device and your use of our Mobile App. When you use the SaaS Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information (“Server Logs”). These Server Logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the SaaS Services, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and such other information. The information contained in Server Logs is used to monitor, assess, manage, diagnose problems with, improve and otherwise administer the SaaS Services.
<br><br>
<b>1.4. Analytics Information.</b> We may use Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Intercom to measure and evaluate access to and traffic on our SaaS Services. Google operates independently from us and has its own privacy policy, which we strongly suggest you review. Google may use the information collected through Google Analytics to evaluate users activity on our Website. For more information, see Google Analytics Privacy and Data Sharing; Mixpanel Privacy Statement and Intercom Terms and Policies.
<br><br>
<b>1.5. Mobile App.</b> When you download, install and use our Mobile App, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Software on your phone. This Software may record certain information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the Mobile App. Subject to this Policy, we will use such data to (i) provide and manage Mobile App; (ii) if you have opted in to receiving push notifications, send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running and/or update you about new features to our SaaS Services; (iii) send you promotional and marketing communications (where you have requested us to do so). If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.
<br><br>
<b>1.6. Information we may collect and/or receive from third parties.</b> We may receive information about you from third parties, such as third party social networking services and other services (“Integrated Service” or “Integrated Services”). You may be given an option to access our SaaS Services through the use of your user name and password through your account created for such other services. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Data with us.

</div>
<div class = title>3. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</div>
<div class = info>
We consider your Personal Data and Customer Data to be a vital part of our relationship with you and do not sell this information to third parties. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data or Customer Data with certain third parties, as follows:
<br><br>
 - <b>Third-Party Service Providers.</b> We sometimes engage certain third-party service providers (“Sub-Processors”) to carry out certain data processing functions on our behalf or to perform certain business-related functions, such as hosting, maintenance, payment processing, or conducting market research. We may also share your email address with third parties, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other services in order to provide custom marketing materials for you on their platforms. When we engage another company to perform a function of this nature, we limit the information provided to these service providers to which is necessary for them to perform their specific function. These companies are not permitted to use any Personal Data or Customer Data that we share with them for any other purpose aside from providing services to us. The list of Sub-Processors is included in the Terms of Service: https://cotano.me/hub/terms-of-service.html.
<br><br>
 - <b>Compliance with Legal Obligations.</b> We may disclose your Personal Data and Customer Data, or other information, if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations, court orders, judicial proceedings or similar legal process, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.
<br><br>
We also reserve the right to disclose Personal Data or other information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the SaaS Services and any facilities or equipment used to make the SaaS Services available, or (v) protect our property or other legal rights, enforce our contracts, or protect the rights, property, or safety of others.
<br><br>
We will take reasonable steps to ensure that we only collect that Personal Data that is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. Furthermore, we will not process your Personal Data in a way that is incompatible with these purposes.
<br><br>
- <b>Change of Ownership.</b> As we develop our business, we may go through a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, or purchase businesses and assets. Your Personal Data or Customer Data may be part of the assets transferred to a buyer or other successor or shared in connection with due diligence for any such transaction. Any acquirer or successor of Cotano may continue to prove data consistent with this Policy.
<br><br>
- <b>De-identified data.</b> We might also share data with third parties if the data has been de-identified or aggregated in a way so it cannot be used to identify a Customer or its Authorized Users.
<br><br>
</div>
<div class = title>4. SECURITY MEASURES</div>
<div class = info>
4.1. To protect confidentiality and integrity of Personal Data of our Customers and Authorized Users, we will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, as described in this Policy and the Terms of Service. These safeguards will include:
<br><br>
 - Authentication measures, including secure methods of assigning, selecting, and storing access credentials, measures designed to restrict access to active users, and blocking access after a reasonable number of failed authentication attempts.
<br><br>
 - Secure access controls, including measures designed to limit access to personal data of data subjects based on need-to-know, supported by appropriate policies, procedures and controls to facilitate access authorization, establishment, modification, and termination.
<br><br>
 - Use of appropriate encryption technologies.
<br><br>
 - Appropriate monitoring systems and other technical security measures intended to prevent and detect security breaches such as firewall protection, antivirus protection, security patch management, logging of access to or disclosure of personal information, and intrusion detection.
<br><br>
 - Appropriate physical security to safeguard facilities and records containing personal information from unauthorized physical access, tampering or theft, such as facility access controls.
<br><br>
 - Training and awareness programs designed to ensure workforce members are aware of and adhere to the security procedures and practices.
<br><br>
 - Data back-up and disaster recovery procedures intended to permit continued provision of service in an emergency or disaster.
<br><br>
 - Periodic assessment of threats and vulnerabilities to personal information and the effectiveness of the security procedures and practices implemented to comply with the GDPR.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, please note that no communication via the Internet can ever be 100% secure, and no security measures can ever be assured to be effective. Accordingly, you are advised to use caution and discretion when determining what Personal Data to disclose to us.
<br><br>

<div class = title>7. EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</div>
<div class = info>
7.1. If you are a natural person residing within the European Economic Area (“Data Subject”), the following additional rights as expressed under the EU General Data Protection Regulation are applicable to you:
<br><br>
 a) <b>Basis for processing Personal Data:</b> When the Customer is a legal entity, our legal basis for the processing of Personal Data may be the fulfillment of a legal contract executed between the Customer and Cotano or the fulfillment of a requested service (legitimate interests). On certain occasions, Cotano relies on the consent of the Data Subject to process Personal Data. Data Subjects must be at least the age of 16 to consent to the processing of their Personal Data. Data Subjects under the age of 16 must obtain their parent’s or legal guardian’s permission to consent to the processing. In other occasions, we may process information when we need to do so to fulfill a contract, provide services or where we are required by law to do so. We may also process data when it is in our legitimate interests to do so and when these interests are not overridden by the Data Subject’s data protection rights (which may vary based on the Data Subject’s jurisdiction). Such legitimate interests include, but are not limited to, operation of our business and services, verifying user’s identity, serving advertisement, improving products and services, analyzing performance, debugging, troubleshooting, and providing customer support.
<br><br> 
 b) <b>Access, correct or update your Personal Data:</b> Cotano takes reasonable steps to ensure that the information we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and up to date. You may access, correct, or modify Personal Data that you provided to Cotano and that is associated with your Account. You may exercise these rights by contacting us as described below.
<br><br> 
 c) <b>Right to Be Forgotten:</b> You may request to have your Personal Data erased, or otherwise request that your Personal Data not be processed. Please note that the SaaS Services, or parts of the SaaS Services, may become inaccessible or otherwise not function properly if you request to have your Personal Data erased or not be processed. You may exercise this right by contacting us as described below.
<br><br> 
 d) <b>Object, Restrict, or Withdraw Consent:</b> You may withdraw consent you previously provided to Cotano or restrict the processing of your Personal Data. Please note that the SaaS Services, or parts of the SaaS Services, may become inaccessible or otherwise not function properly if you withdraw certain consents to restrict the processing of your Personal Data. You may exercise these rights by contacting us as described below.
<br><br> 
 e) <b>Portability:</b> You may request to receive a copy of the Personal Data you have previously provided to us during your use of our SaaS Services. You may do so by contacting us as described below.
<br><br>
 f) <b>International Transfers:</b> Please be aware that the information we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location. Cotano offers European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our Customers that operate in the European Union, and other international transfers of Customer Data. A copy of our standard Data Processing Addendum, incorporating Model Clauses, is available at: https://cotano.me/hub/data-processing-addendum.html.
<br><br>
 g) <b>Right to complain to a data protection authority:</b> If you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.
<br><br>
7.2. If you are a resident of California, under the age of 18 and have registered for an account with us, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to our websites. Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, because, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another visitor to our websites.
<br><br>
</div>
<div class = title>8. WEBSITE DATA BREACHES</div>
<div class = info>
8.1. In the event of an unlawful data breach of our Website’s database or the database(s) of any of our third-party data processors, we will report it to any and all relevant persons and authorities within 72 hours of the breach if it is apparent that personal data stored in an identifiable manner has been stolen.
<br><br>
</div>
<div class = title>9. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</div>
<div class = info>
9.1. This Policy applies only to our Website. The Website may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by us. The policies and procedures described here do not apply to web sites or other services that Cotano does not operate or control. These links from our Website do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed those web sites or other services. We suggest contacting those services directly for information on their privacy policies.

<div class = info>
11.1. Cotano does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Customer Data (including Personal Data) stored or processed by a Customer or Authorized User via the SaaS Services. Only Customer or Authorized Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Customer Data. Cotano is largely unaware of what Customer Data is actually being stored or made available by a Customer or Authorized User to the SaaS Service and does not directly access such Customer Data except as authorized by the Customer, or as necessary to provide SaaS Services to the Customer and its Authorized Users.
<br><br>
11.2. Because Cotano does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Customer Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Cotano is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the GDPR and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. Cotano should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Customers and Authorized Users as to any Customer Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR. Except as provided in this Policy, Cotano does not independently cause Customer Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the SaaS Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Cotano in connection with Cotano’s provision of SaaS Services to Customers. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Customer or Authorized User.
<br><br>
11.3. The Customer or the Authorized User is the data controller under the GDPR for any Customer Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.
<br><br>
11.4. Cotano is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Customer Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the Customer or Authorized User nor is Cotano responsible for the manner in which the Customer or Authorized User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.
