Sales funnel management is not anything new for the sales industry, but there are few that truly do it well. For effective sales funnel management it is important to focus on the three keys Contacts, Tasks and Reminders. 

## Contacts

In sales the prospect or lead must feel as though he or she are the most important person in your long list of contacts. Building a relationship with people that you are trying to sell to is the most challenging part of the buyer’s journey but all is not lost. Today, technology is rapidly developing however companies continue to provide their sales teams with expensive CRMs that are over complicated, lack the tools for creating meaningful approaches, and most importantly they don’t allow for effective sales funnel management. 

## Tasks

Organizing your daily sales activities and tasks becomes cumbersome as your sales funnel grows.Keeping yourself or your sales team focused on revenue generating tasks is the key to continue growing your sales. Believe it or not, only 36% of a salespersons time is actually spent on selling. 

Keeping yourself organized on the tasks that bring value takes prioritizing, organizing, and remembering to always get them done on time. Obviously easier said than done however, there is hope. We recommend organizing your tasks using the proven Kanban methodology because it organizes your processes and is proven to make you more productive.

## Reminders

Building a trustful relationship with leads, doesn’t start with personalization, but in fact remembering the previous conversation and most importantly following up on time. Punctual follow ups demonstrate respect and are the building blocks for gaining your lead’s trust. 

Focusing on contacts, tasks and reminders helps you start managing your sales funnel effectively.
